# Introduction

The chapters included in the __HELLO-WORLD__ section are aimed to create a very simple web server which has the following features:

* A default route `/` that will return the Hello World string.
* A route `/greet/XXXX` where XXXX will be a string chosen by the user and based on this will return a greeting, eg: `Hello XXXX`.
* A route `/bye/XXXX` where XXXX will be a string chosen by the user and based on this will return a farewell, eg: `Bye XXXX`.
