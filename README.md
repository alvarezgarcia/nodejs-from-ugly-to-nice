# Introduction

### Motivation

The spirit of this gitbook is to bring NodeJS closer to anyone who has minimal programming experience but in the past has struggled to understand the concepts of language and the specific patterns it provides.

Some educational resources that we might find tries to initiate the reader, eager to get hadns dirty, to an awful amount of theoretical concepts that can generate the inverse effect on anyone who wants to start with something new.

Others deletes this barriers but replaces the theoretical concepts with pre-existing tools and modules, which can lead the reader to get lost in a myriad of details that, a priori, thinks will not be useful. Mainly because it's not clear how this will help them.

Without doubt, the effort of those who selflessly publish their work to help others is valuable, the material proposed here seeks to explain these same concepts but from another approach.

### Approach

With this difficulties in mind, the strategy here will be to divide the learning path into stages called **sections**, internally divided into **chapters**.

These sections include the development of a project from start to finish, always aligned with what the language has to offer as a strenght.

Each section at the beginning shows what the project to be carried out and progressively, chapter after chapter, develop the features that compose it and improve them.

To the surprise of those who have already had an approach to other tutorials on these specific topics, they will be able to verify that some bad practices, anti-patterns or errors are deliberately included, but even with them they allow the final result to be as expected.
This decision when designing this gitbook allowind these "errors" was to point out these shortcomings and how to improve them.

However, never throughout this document will you try to improve or optimize something that has not been developed in the first instance, eg: Return a dynamic message if our app still does not return a fixed message.

### Structure

Como ya se detalló en el apartado de Estrategia, el material se divide en secciones que engloban un proyecto determinado, estas secciones a su vez son divididas en capítulos que trabajan todos los aspectos de diseño e implementación de los mismos.

Algunos de estos capítulos introducen conceptos nuevos para mejorar lo hecho en capítulos anteriores, otros llevarán al lector a replantearse por qué eso que vio funcionando en el capítulo anterior no es tan prolijo como debera ser o incluso otros simplemente forzarán a refactorizar o actualizar porciones de código para apegarse a nuevos stándares.

Respecto a este último punto, es probable que el lector con menos experiencia pueda tener la sensación de estar "sacrificando" mucho de su código solo para cumplir con un standard, a modo de animar al lectora a implementar estos cambios pero sin que su código principal esté en riesgo, los capítulos que son sobre estos asuntos proveen scripts aparte con fragmentos de código para que puedan ser probados por separados, animando y dando seguridad para luego hacerlos parte del proyecto principal.

As detailed in the Strategy section, the material is divided into sections that encompass a given project, these sections are in turn divided into chapters that work on all aspects of their design and implementation.

Some of these chapters introduce new concepts to improve what was done in previous chapters, others will lead the reader to think again some excersides already done and find ways to improve it.

Regarding this last point, it is likely that the less experienced reader may have the sensation of "sacrificing" much of their code just to comply with a standard, in order to encourage the reader to implement these changes but without their main code be at risk, the chapters that are focused on this will have code separated, this will hopefully will give offer security about not breaking the main project in progress.

### Contents

The different sections will focus on many topics besides NodeJS, such as:

- API Rests and good practices to design them
- Security
- Interface with databases
- Docker
- Serverless
